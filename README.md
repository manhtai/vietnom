## What is Nôm?

Chữ Nôm, is the ancient ideographic vernacular script of the Vietnamese language. 
After Vietnamese independence from China in 939 CE, chữ Nôm, an ideographic script 
that represents Vietnamese speech, became the national script. For the next 1000 
years — from the 10th century and into the 20th—much of Vietnamese literature, philosophy, 
history, law, medicine, religion, and government policy was written in Nôm script. 
During the 24 years of the Tây-Sơn emperors (1788-1802), all administrative documents 
were written in Chữ Nôm. 
In other words, approximately 1,000 years of Vietnamese cultural history is recorded 
in this unique system.

This heritage is now nearly lost. With the 17th century advent of quốc ngữ — the modern 
Roman-style script — Nôm literacy gradually died out.
